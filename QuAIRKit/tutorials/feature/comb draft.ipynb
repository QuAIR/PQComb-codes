    "\n",
    "A **quantum comb** is a framework used to transform quantum processes, providing a flexible way to manipulate unitary operations. `PQCombNet` leverages **Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)** to design and optimize circuits capable of performing various transformations on quantum unitary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `PQCombNet` can be used to train circuits that reverse unknown unitary operations, but its application extends to more general tasks such as complex conjugation and other customized quantum process transformations. By adjusting the parameters of the PQC, the network can be trained to implement different types of quantum transformations with high fidelity.\n",

    "## 2. Initializing PQCombNet <a id=\"initializing\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the `PQCombNet` class, you need to specify several parameters, which define the behavior and structure of the quantum circuit. Below is an explanation of the key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`target_function`**: A callable function that defines the target quantum operation, typically used to optimize the circuit for a specific task. This function should support batch computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`num_slots`**: The number of slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`num_aux_qubits`**: The number of ancilla qubits. These qubits assist in performing the quantum operations and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`num_qubits_U`**: The number of qubits of unitary to be queried. The default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`train_unitary_info`**: Specifies the training dataset. It can either be an integer, which defines the size of an automatically generated dataset, or a custom tensor containing predefined unitary matrices for training. The default value is 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`test_unitary_info`**: Similar to `train_unitary_info`, but for the testing dataset. The default value is 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`train_mode`**: Defines the training mode for the quantum circuit. It can be either `\"pqc\"` (which is memory-efficient but slower) or `\"choi\"` (which is faster but uses more memory). By default, it is set to `\"choi\"`. If memory issues arise during training, the mode will automatically switch to `\"pqc\"` to ensure training continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`LR`**: The initial learning rate used for training the quantum circuit. The default value is 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`NUM_ITR`**: The max number of iterations to run during training. This determines how many times the model will process the training data and update the parameters. The default value is 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`name_task`**: The name of the training task. If not provided, it will default to `\"pqcomb_search_{target_function.__name__}\"`, where `{target_function.__name__}` is the name of the target function. This allows for easy identification and tracking of different training tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`seed`**: Used to set a seed for reproducibility. If specified, this ensures that the same results can be obtained when the training is repeated with the same data and parameters. The default is `None`, meaning no seed is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_save_data`**: A boolean value that indicates whether the training circuits should be saved. If set to `True`, the data will be saved in a directory that includes circuit lists describing combs. The default is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_auto_stop`**: A boolean value that, when set to `True`, stops the training automatically if the learning rate `LR` decreases to $10^{-3}$ of its initial value. This helps prevent unnecessary additional training once the learning rate becomes too small. The default is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_ctrl_U`**: A boolean value specifying whether to apply controlled unitary operations. If `True`, a control qubit will be added to the last ancilla qubit system, and alternating $\\text{ctrl-}U$ and $\\text{ctrl-}U^\\dagger$ operations will be applied. If `False`, the circuit will apply $U$ without control qubits. The default is `False`.\n"
